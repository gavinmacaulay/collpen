Changes from MatPIV 1.6 to 1.61
-----------------------------------------



UPDATED FILES:
-------------

PIXEL2WORLD - updated to also accept a filename as input.

MATPIV - Can now also take a velocity field as input for the initial
window shift. Useful when processing time series where the velocity
field only changes a little from image to image. At the moment this only
works for the 'multin' option.
New option added - 'norm'. Calculates normalized correlations in a
single pass through the images
Parameter-file as input should now work. Briefly tested though...

MULTIPASSX - see above. Also fixed a bug in the image reading where if
you passed an RGB-image (already loaded) instead of the filename, then
the RGB was not converted to grayscale before calculations. This
resulted in Mx3N sized images in the calculations. 

GLOBFILT - Changed the appearance of nanmean to mnanmean.

MSMOOTH - smoothing filter to smooth velocity fields.

DEFINEWOCO - added a hack to the '.' option where you now can specify
approximatly how wide your coordinate points are. This is good if your
points are "very" wide (like 20 pixels or more).


NEW FILES:
---------

AUTOMASK and DYNAMASK - various tries at automatic masking of images.
These will only work if your surface/line does not have too many holes
in it etc. These are very basic tries at automatic masking and they will
be updated in the next release.

MSTREAMLINE - small perturbation of Matlabs original streamline
function. Attempts to guess proper starting values for the
streamlines.

RUNFILE_AVI - example of a runfile for use with an AVI-movie
